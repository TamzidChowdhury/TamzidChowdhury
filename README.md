I’m a Sales Engineer with a background in technical sales, data, and cybersecurity — passionate about helping customers solve real-world problems through innovative technology. I've worked at companies like IBM and ProLion, delivering technical demos, managing proof-of-concepts, and driving customer success across enterprise environments.

Here you'll find a mix of demo projects, automation scripts, and technical experiments — mostly around data pipelines, cloud, and workflow tools.
